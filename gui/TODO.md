## TODO

### PRIORITY:
* Refine user authentication and especially the option to create a new account
* Add a way to add a cycle - should be very easy to implement, but I'm not sure how good an idea it is bc then I'd also have to add the option of deleting cycles? And I'd have to find a nice way to actually add it to the UI.
