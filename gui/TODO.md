## TODO

### PRIORITY:
* Refine user authentication and especially the option to create a new account
* App reloads every time I update a cell in the DF and then it removes the update but when I do it again it retains it? Not sure what is causing it.
* Add some way to set a cycle start/end date so that the average apps per day computations are accurate. If there is no end date, the average number of apps is just gonna approach zero over time even if the cycle was like 3 years ago.

### UI / Minor: 
* Split Rejection section of Acceptance Rate donut into Rejected after Interview and Straight Rejection but also provide the option of combining them. Checkbox or something. Or maybe just have it in the hover message if that's possible.

### Tentative / Ideas:
* I'm thinking it'd be cool to have some stats based on the Tags - as in maybe this tag is associated w/ this result, it's just tough bc most results are gonna be Pending or Rejections.
